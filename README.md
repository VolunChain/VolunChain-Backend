## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

The project follows Domain-Driven Design principles with the following structure:

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ modules/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ project/
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ domain/           # Domain entities and value objects
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ repositories/     # Repository interfaces and implementations
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ use-cases/        # Application business logic
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dto/             # Data Transfer Objects
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/                  # Shared kernel
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ infrastructure/          # External services and implementations
```

### Domain Layer

- Contains business entities and value objects
- Implements domain logic and business rules
- Independent of external concerns

### Repository Layer

- Defines interfaces for data access
- Implements data persistence logic
- Abstracts database operations

### Use Cases Layer

- Implements application business logic
- Orchestrates domain objects
- Handles transaction boundaries

### DTO Layer

- Defines data structures for API communication
- Handles data validation and transformation
- Separates domain models from API contracts

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/volunchain-backend.git
   cd volunchain-backend
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file:

   ```env
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://volunchain:volunchain123@localhost:5432/volunchain
   PORT=3000
   JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
   ```

3. **Start PostgreSQL with Docker**:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

## ü§ù How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a branch for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/new-feature
   ```
3. Commit your changes:
   i. The project uses pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality. They will automatically:

   - Run ESLint to check code style
   - Run Prettier to format code
   - Run tests to ensure everything works

   ii. For urgent commits that need to bypass checks:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "urgent fix" --no-verify
   ```

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add new feature"
   ```

4. Push and create a Pull Request.

## Rate Limiting Configuration

The application implements rate limiting to protect sensitive endpoints and prevent abuse.

### Configuration

Rate limiting can be configured via environment variables:

- `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS`: Time window for rate limiting in milliseconds (default: 15 minutes)
- `RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS`: Maximum number of requests allowed in the time window (default: 100)
- `RATE_LIMIT_MESSAGE`: Custom message when rate limit is exceeded

### Protected Endpoints

The following endpoints have rate limiting:

- `/auth/login`
- `/auth/register`
- Wallet verification endpoints
- Email-related endpoints

### Customization

You can adjust rate limit settings in your `.env` file or use the default configurations.

# Email Verification System

## Overview

The Email Verification system allows users to verify their email addresses during the registration process, ensuring the authenticity of user accounts and adding an extra layer of security to the application.

## Features

-   Automatic email verification token generation and sending during registration
-   Token expiration after 24 hours for security
-   Email verification endpoint to validate tokens
-   Resend verification email functionality for users who did not receive or have expired tokens
-   Authentication middleware that restricts access to authenticated routes for non-verified users

## Usage

### Registration Flow

1.  When a user registers, the system automatically sends a verification email to the provided email address.
2.  The email contains a unique verification link with a token parameter.
3.  The token is valid for 24 hours.

### Verification Process

1.  When the user clicks the verification link, the system validates the token.
2.  If the token is valid and not expired, the user's email is marked as verified.
3.  The user can now access authenticated routes that require verification.

### Resending Verification Email

If a user did not receive the verification email or the token has expired, they can request a new verification email:

1.  User makes a `POST` request to `/api/auth/resend-verification-email` with their email address.
2.  The system generates a new token and sends a fresh verification email.

## API Endpoints

### Registration and Verification

- `POST /auth/register` - Register a new user and send verification email
- `GET /auth/verify-email/:token` - Verify email using the token from the email link
- `POST /auth/resend-verification` - Resend the verification email
- `GET /auth/verification-status` - Check if the current user's email is verified

### Authentication with Verification Check

## Implementation Details

The email verification system follows Domain-Driven Design principles:

-   **Domain Layer:**
    -   `User` entity extended with `isVerified`, `verificationToken`, and `verificationTokenExpires` attributes
    -   `IUserRepository` interface updated with verification-related methods
-   **Repository Layer:**
    -   `PrismaUserRepository` implements methods for finding users by verification token, setting tokens, and verifying users
-   **Use Cases:**
    -   `SendVerificationEmailUseCase`: Handles sending verification emails to users
    -   `VerifyEmailUseCase`: Validates tokens and marks users as verified
    -   `ResendVerificationEmailUseCase`: Generates new tokens and resends verification emails
-   **Authentication:**
    -   `AuthMiddleware` has been updated to check if a user is verified before allowing access to protected routes

## Environment Configuration

The email verification system requires the following environment variables:

- `JWT_SECRET` - Secret key for JWT tokens
- `EMAIL_SECRET` - Secret key for verification tokens
- `EMAIL_SERVICE` - Email service provider (e.g., 'gmail')
- `EMAIL_USER` - Email address for sending verification emails
- `EMAIL_PASSWORD` - Password for the email account
- `BASE_URL` - Base URL for verification links (e.g., 'http://localhost:3000')
